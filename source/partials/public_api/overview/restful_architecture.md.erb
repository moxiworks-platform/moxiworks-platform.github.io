### RESTful Architecture

```apires
Resources:

/contacts
/events
/tasks
```

The response payload is JSON encoded object(s) with defined structure which reflects a data model.

<aside class="notice">Some of the data returned by the Moxi Works API is user-generated content. Ensure that the response payload content is consumed safely to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in your application.</aside>

URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions. For example, to get a list of contacts, use `GET https://api.moxiworks.com/contacts`. 
This will return a list of Contact objects, where each Contact will have an "id" attribute. 
To get details on a particular contact, use `GET https://api.moxiworks.com/contacts/123456`, where 123456 is the "id" of the Contact you want. 
Similarly, to create a Contact, `POST` a Contact object to `https://api.moxiworks.com/contacts/`.
